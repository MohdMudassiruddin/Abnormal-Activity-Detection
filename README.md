# Abnormal-Activity-Detection
Based on the details from the project, I used and downloaded several tools and technologies.

the key technologies and libraries used in your project:

Python: 3.10.x
PyTorch: 2.0.1
Torchvision: 0.15.2
YOLOv5: Custom model for object detection
Flask: Web framework for serving the application
OpenCV: Computer vision library
Playsound: For playing sound notifications (if applicable)
Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.10.x installed on your system.
(Optional) Set up a virtual environment.


Here’s a summary:
1. Python Version: Python 3.10.X
2. Deep Learning Frameworks:
PyTorch: A popular deep learning framework used for training and deploying models.
TensorFlow: Another deep learning framework used for training and deploying models.
3. Machine Learning Models:
YOLOv5: A state-of-the-art object detection model. Your script loads a YOLOv5 model from a local file (best.pt).
4. Computer Vision Libraries:
OpenCV (cv2): Used for computer vision tasks.
5. Web Framework:
Flask: A lightweight web framework used to create a web server for serving the application.
6. Additional Libraries:
playsound: Used for playing sound files (though it was not  part of your final setup as per the logs).
torchvision: Provides image transformations and utilities for PyTorch.
7. Package Managers:
pip: The package manager used for installing Python libraries.
8. Development Tools:
Anaconda/Miniconda: A distribution of Python that includes package management and environment management tools.
9. Dependencies:
libifcoremd.dll: A Fortran runtime library, indicating that some dependencies might be compiled with Fortran.
KERNELBASE.dll, KERNEL32.DLL, ntdll.dll: System DLLs related to Windows error handling and process management.
10. Miscellaneous:
requirements.txt (extra): Your application might be looking for this file to check for additional dependencies.



Summary:
I’ve used various tools and technologies to build and deploy the project, primarily focused on deep learning and web development. If you need to ensure everything is set up correctly or install additional dependencies, you have to see and review your project requirements and dependencies.
